    "\n",
    "- Gain experience with Python, a popular scripting language used for ML/AI projects and research\n",
    "- Get familiar with Python's notation for lists and objects\n",
    "- Experiment with Python's unique functionalities for processing lists and objects\n",
    "- Learn to load and process `CSV` files using Python"

    "- What's the average rating for California wines ?\n",
    "- What's the most expensive wine from Spain ?\n",
    "- Where's the worse wine in the US from ?\n",
    "- Which country between spain/us/france has highest average price ?\n",
    "- Which country between spain/us/france has highest average quality points ?\n",
    "- Are the best wines also the most expensive ?\n",
    "\n",
    "The last question is a bit hard to answer definitively with just loops, but what we can do is come up with a couple of searches to find counterexamples. For example, are there top rated wines (say, more than $92$ points) that are also cheap (less than $\\$20$) ?"
